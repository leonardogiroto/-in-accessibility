# InAccessibility

Simple project that shows that automated testing and validations are not enough for good accessibility.  

The project has perfect scores for SEO and Accesibility on Lighthouse and passes Axe audits.  
However, though the markup and contents are valid, it is providing a very bad accesibility experience for assitive technologies users.
